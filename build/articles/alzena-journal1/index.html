          <section class="content"><p>Oh boy was today a day! I’ve got a new bed to lay on and yet another roof over my head~! How did little ol’ me manage to pull this one off? Phew, where to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>begin??</p>
<p>I found a flyer that blew by into an alley I was sleeping in. It was an ad for a new tavern opening up in the Goblet, “La Famiglia Eterna” I think it was! So naturally I went to apply, just to get my feet wet and see how my dance skills measured<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>up!</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>When I got there, a really pretty lady stood at the entrance and greeted me! Her name was “Pylea Ashewood”. A woman of few words, but I can tell she has a squishy heart of gold! Hehe, I would have hugged her or kissed her on the cheek, but she seemed like something was bothering<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>her. </p>
<p>She led me downstairs and I was very impressed at how beautiful and open their bar setup was! Complete with a stage worthy of my performance! Pypy tested my skills there and had me audition, so I kicked it up a few notches and gave her the best strip tease samba that I could conjur up~! How did I do you ask? Well! There was a man there by the name of “Kodi”, he <span class="caps">OBVIOUSLY</span> gave me his approval. But female eyes are a bit more discerning when it comes to this sort of performance, and unfortunately for me the room was filled with mostly other<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>women! </p>
<p>A lovely Auri lady by the name of “Yuri” caught my eye! She filled me with praise and was also a sweetheart to me! Oh! Did I mention that after the performance she fed me chocolate? Ahhh I wanted to shower that girl with a thousand kisses! Oh! The performance~! By the end of it I was missing all of my clothing and felt <span class="caps">COMPLETELY</span> nervous. Truthfully, I’m not used to performing almost exclusively for women, so I felt a little shameful! Still! I faked it really hard and gave Pypy some flirty winks and kisses. She tried to hide it, but I’m pretty sure I could see her blushing from where I stood, or at the very least<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>smirking!</p>
<p>Either way she hired me and in exchange for my dance, gave me shelter and protection. Ugh, when they asked me what I wanted to be paid, I completely blanked, and ended up telling them my hellish nightmare of a situation as an ex-brothel girl being hunted down by traffikers. I couldn’t help myself and ended up crying my eyes out, gosh I’m such a mess! Pypy and Yuri were super sweet and were there for me. They both decided to take me under their wing, so here I am now! A hired dancer for the “La Famiglia Eterna”! Not <span class="caps">QUITE</span> the stage I performed on at the Gold Saucer, but hey, it beats having to get on my back for the highest bidder <em>after</em> the performance. So glad those days are finally behind<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>me!</p>
