Just a few nights ago I met up with the Lavender Lady herself! Ohh how exciting that was! A few years ago, down in the dark stalls of the brothels, her name came up a great many times. Past clients, wealthy elite, and even the other girls in the stalls neighboring mine all had something to say about the infamous “Lunae Lux”. People either wanted to kiss her, kill her, or be her, and after happening upon one of her dances I was one of them! I knew going in I was meeting someone as breathtakingly gorgeous as they were powerful!

Through hearsay, I happened upon some rare knowledge! The crime empress herself happens to give tarot readings to only a select few! Oh how magical! But still, I wasn’t sure if those rumors were even true. Naturally, I had to find out! So I took a chance and walked straight up to her doorstep, invited myself in, looked her straight in the eye, and asked her for one! I half expected her to tell me she had never done a reading in her life and throw me out! But to my surprise she ACTUALLY knew how, and was more than happy to give me one. What a lucky bunny I am!

Lunae had a very mysterious veil about her, and at times it made me a little nervous! Of course I laughed, smiled, winked, and acted like my usual self~! But goddess help me was I shaking! She picked up her cards calmly and smiled reassuringly, no doubt seeing straight through my ruse. As she read my fortune, she listed my life story quite effortlessly. Was I that simple and easy to read? Ohh how naked I felt! Meanwhile, what seemed like an endless line of suitors, admirers, and people with whom she had past dealings with came up to speak with her. It made me realize how lucky I was to even be sitting with her for a private reading!

At the reading’s conclusion I came clean, admitted why I was there to see her, and talked a little about my past. I mean! Obviously she knows I quite admire and find her deliciously attractive~! But I’m not so sure she knew of the danger I was in, and how at that very moment people were searching to put me back in shackles. Lunae shared a small piece of her past with me. Turns out she was once in shackles as well. How horrible! 

She offered me a place in her company, and even a spotlight at her company event coming up soon! Oh what an honor! Now the only remaining question… what to wear? Hmm!
