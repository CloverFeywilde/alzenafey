## Bio:
Alzena is a Ravaa viera. When she came of age, Alzena left her home in the Golmore Jungle to make for Dalmasca. Unfortunately not long after she got there, she was captured and brought forcibly to Uldah where she was held captive and worked as a brothel girl for years. Eventually, Alzena's charms and skill as a dancer won her favour with the rich and elite of Eorzea. She was sent to the Golden Saucer where she danced and worked as an entertainer for the upper echelon. Alzena's alluring performances became well known across Eorzea, and eventually earned her enough reputation, favour, and gil to afford her the rare chance at buying her freedom. She now wanders Eorzea, keeping a low profile and avoiding the rich an elite who desperately wish to claim her once again as their own.
