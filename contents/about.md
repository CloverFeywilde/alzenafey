This blog is home to writing, RP character sheets, screenshots, and personal artwork dealing with FFXIV and my character, Alzena Fey. She's been with me for almost 10 years now.

This blog is self hosted and run by myself. I'm actually a web developer, so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to play with tech and make this myself!

This blog is NSFW by default! So heads up if you're sensitive to that type of thing. 

Follow me on: [My Personal Twitter][1] for everything FFXIV related, and on [My Professional Twitter][2] for updates with my game projects and artwork.
